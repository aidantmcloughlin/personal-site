I'm a PhD student in the Graduate Group in Biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am jointly advised by Haiyan Huang and Lexin Li. My primary interests are in developing methods for unsupervised analysis of high-dimensional, multimodal genomics data. I am currently focused on manipulating deep learning frameworks to detect relationships between features in these multimodal data.  I am also interested in deep reinforcement learning and how it may be improved to assist in designing closed loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy.
